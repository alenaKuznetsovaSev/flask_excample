Before running Flask needs to be told how to import it, by setting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

*(venv) $ export FLASK_APP=main.py*

You can run your first web application, with the following command:

*(venv) $ flask run*

Install Flask-WTF(it's used for web forms) in your virtual environment:

*(venv) $ pip3 install flask-wtf*
